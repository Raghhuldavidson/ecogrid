EcoGrid-Project is a comprehensive tool designed to manage and analyze the condition of systems, focusing specifically on roads, pipes and cables. This project uses data stored in CSV files (EcoGrid.csv) and uses machine learning techniques, specifically gradient boosting machines (GBM), to predict and track demand. The system can also record and report the impact of damage on buildings, providing details of emergency maintenance
